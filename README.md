The basic program made in Slug

## About this Project
A Hobby Programming Language Made In Python.

This is inspired in [Tsoding's Porth](https://gitlab.com/tsoding/porth) Programming Language.

## Quick Start
Make sure you have `rust` installed in your system as slug code translates into rust code.

First, you need to execute the [build.sh](./build.sh) script to have a `slug` executable in your system.
```console
$ ./build.sh && slug
```

To display help:
```console
$ slug -h 
```

To compile program(WARNING: compilation is still work in progress, but you can use it now.):
```console
$ slug -c <filename>
```

## Language Basics
To put a number into a stack and print it you do:
```
put 20 write
```

To add numbers and print it you do:
```
put 20
put 30
+ write
```

To subtract numbers and print it you do:
```
put 30
put 20
- write
```

To multiply numbers and print it you do:
```
put 20
put 30
* write
```

To divide numbers and print it you do:
```
put 2
put 20
/ write
```

Variable assigning:
```
put 5 as a
put 6 as b
+ as c
a write
b write
c write
```

For-loop:
```
put 1 as i
for i .. 10 do
  10 write
  20 write
  30 write
end
```
While-loop(<):
```
while 1 < 10 do
  5 write
end
```
While-loop(>)
```
while 10 > 1 do
  2 write
end
```
While-loop(=)
```
put 1 as i
while i = 1 do
  15 write
end
```
While-loop(!)
```
put 1 as i
while i ! 1 do
  100 write
end
```
While-loop(true/false)
```
while true do
  1 write
end
while false do
  0 write
end
```
